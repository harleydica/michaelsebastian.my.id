## So, What is Global Game Jam?

**Global game jam** is an event that is held in 107 countries all around the world this event is a wild and crazy party 🎉 where game developers come together, bring their laptops and caffeine, and try to make a game in 48 hours.

## What do i work in this Game Jam?

In this experience i was given an experience to meet with a lot of talented and amazing people. Mainly my **Game Designer** and **Progammer**, my role was an **3d Artist** that was given a task to create all the 3d models in the game. P.S some were taken from [itch.io](https://itch.io/)🤣. Here are some screenshots of my works as an **3d Artist** in this game 🙌
